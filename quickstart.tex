This document serves as an introduction to the use of Theo-IDE, a program developed for a project named
\Important{Integrated Development Enviroment for LOOP, WHILE and GOTO} at 
the University of Applied Sciences WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt.
LOOP, WHILE and GOTO \cite[schoening] (hereafter referred to as \Important{the project languages}) are the names of a range 
of simple concept programming languages used within lectures such as 
\Important{Foundations of Theoretical Computer Science} and are used for demonstrating
a range of concepts and isomorphisms in computability theory. Theo-IDE provides a simple explorative enviroment for 
developing, running and debugging programs written in these languages.
